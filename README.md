ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shazi!
ðŸŽ“ Junior at University of California, San Diego, studying Computer Science
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software Engineer and Machine Learning and Data Science

Iâ€™m all about solving real-world problems with data â€” especially when it comes to building models that actually do something. Iâ€™ve been deepening my skills in machine learning and data science lately, both independently and as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow (itâ€™s been such a growth experience â€” feel free to ask me about it!). Iâ€™m constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing myself to improve, whether itâ€™s through coding projects, collaborative work, or late-night debugging sessions. Iâ€™m currently looking for an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects, grow my technical skills, and learn from industry mentors. Got any leads? Iâ€™d love to hear from you!

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
A matcha latte is my favorite accessory, and you can find me with it when coding to my favorite Lo-Fi playlist, engaging in fun-yet-charged discussion on AI ethics with my Women in Tech group, or decompressing with a TikTok scroll.
