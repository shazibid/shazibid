# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shazi!

## ðŸŽ“ Junior at University of California, San Diego â€” Computer Science Major  
## ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software Engineer | Machine Learning & Data Science Enthusiast

Iâ€™m all about solving real-world problems with data â€” especially when it comes to building models that actually *do* something. Iâ€™ve been deepening my skills in machine learning and data science lately, both independently and as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow (itâ€™s been such a growth experience â€” feel free to ask me about it!). Iâ€™m constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing myself to improve, whether itâ€™s through coding projects, collaborative work, or late-night debugging sessions.

Iâ€™m currently looking for an internship where I can contribute to meaningful projects, grow my technical skills, and learn from industry mentors. Got any leads? Iâ€™d love to hear from you!

## âœ¨ Fun Fact

Most days, youâ€™ll find me coding with a coffee nearby and music playing in the background â€” usually a mix of SZA, Billie Eilish, lo-fi, or anything that helps me focus. I love diving into conversations around AI, especially with other women in tech, and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow. Outside of tech, I unwind through art, gaming, music, or getting lost in a good scroll when my brain needs a break.
